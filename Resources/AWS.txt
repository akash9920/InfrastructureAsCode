IAM : Identity and Access Management

A security descipline, enables yout to securely control access
to AWS services and resources of your  users.(right individuhtal,right resource,right time,
                                              right reason)

---- > user, groups, use permisssion

Feautures: 
1) shared access to your AWS account, grant permission to other people w/o sharing your credentials

2) Granular permission: diff ppl , diff role, diff permission

3) Secure access to AWS resourcs to applications run on Ec2

benefits

1) Enhanced security: create user,credentialsgiven, SG association, SG policies
2) Granular control: ex--> ec2 read s3
3) Temp credentials:  for
4) flexible security credentials Management: mfa
5) leverage external identitiy systems: giving aws console access to someone, ex: 
6) seamlessly integrated into aws services:

I am Best practices:

1) keep access keys safe
2) use policies defined by aws if possible
3)user---> grp---> permissions
4) gd pw policy
5) mfa enables
6) use roles for applications
rotate credentials

----------Virtualization and EC2------------

virtualization: computer hardware,storage devices,

Benefit: upfront cost, Reduce cost , effeciency increases, Agility, 
        reduce down time,

woroking: allows one virtual system and multple OS

Hypervisor: A thin layer of software called a hypervisordecouples the virtual machines from the host and dynamically 
            allocates computing resources to each virtual machine as needed.

EC2 advantages:

• Elastic Computing 
• Complete Control 
• Flexibility 
• Reliable 
• Secure 
• Pay-as-you-go 
• Integrated* 
• Easy to Start

EC2 Types:
1) General Purpose
2) Compute Optimized
3) Memory Optimized
4) Acclerated Computing
5) Storage Optimized

EC2 Various pricing models 
• On-Demand
• Spot Instances
• Reserved Instances
• Dedicated Hosts
• Dedicated Instances
