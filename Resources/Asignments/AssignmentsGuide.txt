First we are Creating netwrok stack.

  Stack is created,need to add resources to that. The are as follows:
    a) VPC
    b) IntergerGateway
        1) Internet gateway atached to VPC
    c) Route Table(refered to VPC)
        1) routes are defined
    d)Subnet is defined
    e) Make table -- >Subnet is  association with route table -->ex  "SubnetId" : { "Ref" : "myPubSubnet1" },
                                                                     "RouteTableId" : { "Ref" : "routeTable1" }
        Similarly, we can repeat d and e for other subnet and attach association
        In our assignment we have created two route tables, each for 3 private and 3 public
    f) DBS group is created ---- >DBS subnet group for RDS, we can associate subnet with this group,
       In our case we added 2 private subnets
    g) Security Groups define:
        1) Security Group is created for web server,
           Enable HTTP access via port 80,
           SSH access via port 22,
           HTTPS access via port 443,
           NodeJS access via port 3000"
           // In this we are allowing incoming traffic from anywhere from the world to the above mentioned ports
        
        2) DB security Group,
           allows ingress traffic only from Web App,port 3306
           CIDR block--------- ???
    

    This is the end of the network Stack JSON, now we are exporting the VPC,
    // better way is not to import the files and directly
    security group ids, and subnets. Now we will go to the application stack


    Application Stack:

    a) Define Paramters name: of all the resources that you have and will be creating.
        ex: Stackname, dbSubnet,s3Domain
        






--------------need to read------------

1) How route table is defined destination cidr block, IG etc.
2) CIDR block for DB
