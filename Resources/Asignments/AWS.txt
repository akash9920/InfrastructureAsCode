IAM : Identity and Access Management

A security descipline, enables yout to securely control access
to AWS services and resources of your  users.(right individuhtal,right resource,right time,
                                              right reason)

---- > user, groups, use permisssion

Feautures: 
1) shared access to your AWS account, grant permission to other people w/o sharing your credentials

2) Granular permission: diff ppl , diff role, diff permission

3) Secure access to AWS resourcs to applications run on Ec2

benefits

1) Enhanced security: create user,credentialsgiven, SG association, SG policies
2) Granular control: ex--> ec2 read s3
3) Temp credentials:  for
4) flexible security credentials Management: mfa
5) leverage external identitiy systems: giving aws console access to someone, ex: 
6) seamlessly integrated into aws services:

I am Best practices:

1) keep access keys safe
2) use policies defined by aws if possible
3)user---> grp---> permissions
4) gd pw policy
5) mfa enables
6) use roles for applications
rotate credentials

----------Virtualization and EC2------------

virtualization: computer hardware,storage devices,

Benefit: upfront cost, Reduce cost , effeciency increases, Agility, 
        reduce down time,

woroking: allows one virtual system and multple OS

Hypervisor: A thin layer of software called a hypervisordecouples the virtual machines from the host and dynamically 
            allocates computing resources to each virtual machine as needed.

EC2 advantages:

• Elastic Computing 
• Complete Control 
• Flexibility 
• Reliable 
• Secure 
• Pay-as-you-go 
• Integrated* 
• Easy to Start

EC2 Types:
1) General Purpose
2) Compute Optimized
3) Memory Optimized
4) Acclerated Computing
5) Storage Optimized

EC2 Various pricing models 
• On-Demand --> pay by the hour, no long term commitment or upfornt payment
            --> SHort term and unpredictable loads
• Spot Instances --> Urgent!!, low computing apps
• Reserved Instances --> Assigned to specific availability zone and provide capacity reservation, for steaddy applications and predictable usage
                     --> Recmm for 1-3 years of ec2 usage
• Dedicated Hosts --> Physical ec2 server for your use
                  --> You can bring your server into AWS umbrella
• Dedicated Instances --> amazon EC2 that run in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a user
                      --> Isolated at hardware level

Amazon EC2 Features
• Secure login using key pairs
• Temporary & Permanent Storage Volumes 
• Security Groups (firewalls)
• Static IPv4 address (Elastic IP address)
• Metadata, known as tags
• Subnets (virtual networks)



---------------------DOubts------------

Doubts:
Hypervisor??
You can bring your server into AWS umbrella??
Elastic IP for multiple ec2 Instances?



-------------------Notes------------


Notes:
1) policies are added to user,roles and groups. 
2)
